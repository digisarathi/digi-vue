SEEDS is a NGO based out of Jamshedpur that works with the tribal and backward caste communities towards enhancing their equity and access to justice.

digiSarathi was given the opportunity to design and develop their website [seedsjsr.org](http://seedsjsr.org)

We took about four months to go live with the new website. SEEDS helps the local community to create art work as a means of sustainable income. SEEDS also creates training publications for its partner NGOs and communities. The website enables SEEDS to showcase these services and its social impact to a larger audience.
