### What Are UX and UI?

**UX** is all about how a product feels to use—easy, fun, and helpful for everyone, including those with different needs.

**UI** is the look and feel: colors, buttons, and layouts that make it simple to click and navigate.

Together, they create apps and websites that work well and look great, meeting user needs while hitting business goals.
