    <p>Hi everyone,</p>

    <p>
      I'm excited to share that we are building a new project management tool, and I'm looking for small teams to try it out. If your team is between 3-5 people, you'd be perfect for this initial testing phase.
    </p>

    <h3>What's in it for you</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Early access to all features</li>
      <li>Direct input into the product roadmap</li>
      <li>Priority support from us</li>
      <li>Free usage during the beta period</li>
      <li>50% off your first year when you switch to a paid plan (if you register within 2 weeks)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interested? Just email us the following on <a href="mailto:admin@digisarathi.com">admin@digisarathi.com</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your team size</li>
      <li>What you're currently using for project management</li>
      <li>When you could start (aiming to begin this week)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Looking forward to having some of you onboard!</em></p>
