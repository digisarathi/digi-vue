Hi everyone,

I’m excited to share that we are building a new project management tool, and I’m looking for small teams to try it out. If your team is between 3-5 people, you’d be perfect for this initial testing phase.

### What’s in it for you

Early access to all features  
Direct input into the product roadmap  
Priority support from us  
Free usage during the beta period  
50% off your first year when you switch to a paid plan (if you register within 2 weeks)</kbd></mark>

### Interested? Just email us the following on <a href="mailto:admin@digisarathi.com">admin@digisarathi.com</a>

- Your team size
- What you're currently using for project management
- When you could start (aiming to begin this week)</kbd>


*Looking forward to having some of you onboard!*
