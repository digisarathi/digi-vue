      For SMEs and MSMEs in manufacturing, especially in India, Pune, and Southeast Asia, a practical, incremental
      approach to IoT adoption can drive factory digitization toward increased efficiency, predictive maintenance, and
      real-time monitoring—all while balancing cost and complexity.

    <h4>
      A Comprehensive Digital Transformation Story for SMEs/MSMEs
    </h4>

    <h3>
      Starting Point: Why Incremental IoT?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Digitizing factory operations doesn’t require a full overhaul upfront. SMEs can start small by deploying sensors
      for
      equipment monitoring, energy usage, and environment conditions. This generates valuable real-time data to optimize
      production without disrupting existing workflows.
