How do you know if your website is effective?</figcaption></figure>In our previous newsletter, we discussed how a website is primarily providing information to its visitors. But how do we know which information is being read by the visitor, which topics are more interesting and which information is not being consumed. The answer is ‘Analytics’. While there are several different analytics modules in the market, the defacto standard seems to be [​Google Analytics (GA)​](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/). GA also seemlessly integrates into Google Search which will give you insights into what keywords of search by the visitor brought the visitor to your website.

We recently onboarded one of India’s most reputed and impactful NGOs, [​Majlis Manch​](www.majlislaw.com) in our Website Design &amp; Maintenance services. and our first step was to install Google Analytics (GA) in their website.

### For any website we make or maintain, the first thing we check &amp; install is the Analytics module

With GA &amp; its many features, Majlis can now gather comprehensive data on visitor behaviour on their site, allowing Majlis Law to identify popular content and optimize their online presence accordingly. By tracking key metrics such as page views, session duration, and user demographics, they can measure the effectiveness of their outreach efforts and improve engagement with their audience.

This **data-driven approach** not only helps in understanding the return on investment for their digital initiatives but also empowers them to refine their strategies for greater impact. So, if you are a NGO leader or the Fundraising or Communications Manager for a NGO, then make sure your website analytics metrics are available at your fingertips and plan accordingly.
