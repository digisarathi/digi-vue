Prerana, Mumbai with ADM Foundation launched ‘Aarambh India’ to provide the much needed impetus to the Child Sexual Abuse situation in India. They decided adopting digital medium was the best way to bring increased focus on the topic and share best practises with the hundreds of nonprofits in India that work with children.

Aarambh team &amp; digiSarathi got together to design and develop an online portal catering to the different stakeholders, content types and its consumption channels. Look &amp; feel options were created and scrutinized, code tested on different devices and we went live on World Children’s Day (November 19th annually).

Today even years later, with only a minimum of security updates and maintenance on the tech side, the Aarambh team is able to regularly put out awareness campaigns, video snippets and truly engage its related audience and spread knowledge.
