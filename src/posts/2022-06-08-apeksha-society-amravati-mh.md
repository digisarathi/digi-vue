Apeksha Homoeo Society has been involved in community development for over 41 years. Based out of Amravati, Maharashtra, Apeksha focuses on children welfare and women empowerment.

In particular, Apeksha caters to the needs of ‘_Ekal Mahila_‘ or single women (widowed, divorcee, separated) who face greater discrimination in society.

digiSarathi was tasked with renewing the website and giving it a contemporary tone of design and communication of their social impact.
