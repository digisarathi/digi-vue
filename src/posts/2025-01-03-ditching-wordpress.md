My team of engineers &amp; designers don’t blog! We just don’t have the time for it. But for 11 years now, we have been footing the bill for hosting and maintenance of the digiSarathi website – all because of WordPress! Maintaining a WordPress site takes up significant time and effort which is increasing year on year. Not to forget the security risks and the plugin conflicts. But, if no one is blogging regularly then WordPress and its complications today is an overkill!

A website is essentially 4/5 pages that talks about any organization and its programs. Then I remembered how one of our clients, [​ThoughtShop Foundation​](https://thoughtshopfoundation.org/), in Kolkatta, have a non-WordPress website. Whenever needed, they make some ‘content’ updates in the Team or Donor section. Without WordPress, there is no ‘software’ updates or the bare minimum. But with WordPress, the software updates is as frequent as the ‘apps’ on our phone, i.e. forever &amp; ever! Which means the cost of AMC that digiSarathi or other IT vendors charge their clients is not coming down. This didn’t feel right!

So, a month back, we started researching on alternative technologies that would work for a SME like digiSarathi and NGOs that simplifies the whole equation. And voila, not only can we have a blogging module without WordPress but also make use of ‘Free Hosting’ provided by Microsoft and other platforms. By month-end, digiSarathi website will be redone without WordPress and on free hosting. Looking forward to sharing our findings soon!
